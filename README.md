RetroPie Extras install scripts for Jetson Nano

This is all WIP right now. 

I still have a handfull of edits i need to get done, but as of 9-20-23 all the scripts do install. and almost all do play
there are a few i have not tested yet as i dont have the game files (yet)

if you want background music i have figured that out also
all you need to do is add a ``music`` folder here 

``/opt/ares/configs/all/emulationstation``
